# Real-Estate Analysis of Vancouver Neighbourhoods

## Introduction

In terms of realty analytics, it often involves understanding the basic concepts surrounding the ability of a property's value and obtainable revenue. This, in turn, provides the reason for investment and lots of planning and decision-making for it to succeed. A neighbourhood/community-wise Analysis of Residential Real Estate would provide a better understanding in determining which neighbourhood would offer a good return on investment, which is the goal of this project.

Vancouver is one of the largest and most populous cities in Canada, known for being diverse, multicultural and home to world class-amenities, making it a great place to invest in a house(or an apartment)!

When investing in a property, an overall market analysis will provide a good idea of the trends, but more is needed. It is imperative to buy property in the right neighbourhood because even if the overall market is excellent, a wrong location may lead to decreased property value in the future.

A Neighbourhood Analysis will reveal the investment potential of various neighbourhoods based on their characteristics and intrinsic values.
